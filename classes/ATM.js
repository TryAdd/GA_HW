// Your First Lab:
// Make an ATM
// For this exercise you will be creating an ATM class.
// It will have the following properties...
// type (e.g., “checking”), which should be determined by some input
// money, which should start out as 0
// It should have the following methods...
// withdraw, which should decrease the amount of money by some input
// deposit, which should increase the amount of money by some input
// showBalance, which should print the amount of money in the bank to the console.
// The Atm class has a transactionHistory property 
// which keeps track of the withdrawals and deposits made to the account.
// Make sure to indicate whether the transaction increased or decreased the amount of money 
// in the bank.
// Bonus
// Give the Atm class a backupAccount property that can, optionally, contain a reference to
//  another instance of the class, determined by some input
// Whenever an ATM’s balance goes below zero, it will remove money from the instance stored in
//  backupAccount so that its balance goes back to zero.
// This should trigger a withdrawal in the back up account equal to the amount of money that was
// withdrawn from the original account.
class ATM{
    constructor(type, money=0){
        this.type = type
        this.money = money
        this.transactionHistory = []
    }
    withdraw(amount){
        this.money = this.money - amount
        this.transactionHistory.push(-amount)
    }

    deposit(amount){
        this.money += amount
        this.transactionHistory.push(+amount)
    }
    showBalance(){
        return this.money
        // this.transactionHistory.push(amount)
    }

} 

const atm = new ATM('personal', 200)
console.log(atm)
atm.withdraw(200);
console.log(atm)
atm.deposit(400)
console.log(atm)
